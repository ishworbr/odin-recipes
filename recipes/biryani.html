    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3½ cups water</li>
        <li>2⅓ cups basmati rice</li>
        <li>4 bay leaves, divided</li>
        <li>½ cup warm milk</li>
        <li>1 pinch saffron threads</li>
        <li>¼ cup ghee (clarified butter), divided</li>
        <li>2 onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 green chile peppers, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place black peppercorns, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon sticks, star 
            anise, and kala jeera in a spice grinder; grind into a fine powder.</li>
        <li>Place cilantro and mint leaves in a food processor; pulse until coarsely 
            chopped.</li>
        <li>Combine spice powder, cilantro-mint mixture, yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic 
            paste, chile powder, biryani masala powder, and turmeric in a large bowl. Add 
            chicken; turn to coat evenly. Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate in the 
            refrigerator, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan; add 2 bay leaves. Reduce heat to 
            medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is partially cooked through and still 
            firm, about 5 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Combine milk and saffron in a small bowl; stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Heat ghee in a large pot with a tight-fitting lid over medium-high heat. 
            Add onions; cook and stir until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Drain on 
            paper towels. Reduce heat to low. Add remaining 2 bay leaves and chile peppers;
            cook and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Carefully remove 1 tablespoon of 
            ghee from the pot; set it aside.</li>
        <li>Wipe excess marinade off the chicken, discarding marinade, and add to the pot. 
            Cook over medium heat until no longer pink, about 2 minutes per side. Spread 
            drained rice on top. Sprinkle onions on top of the rice. Drizzle reserved ghee 
            and saffron milk over onions and rice.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot and cook over high heat, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to low and 
            continue cooking, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, 
            until rice is tender and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the chicken 
            reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 15 minutes.</li>
